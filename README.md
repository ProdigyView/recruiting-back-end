# Overview

Here at ShootProof, we prefer to have a good idea of a candidate's technical
experience before proceeding with portions of our recruiting process.  We
believe that the technical exercise below will illustrate a candidate's
approach to working with technologies commonly used here at ShootProof.

# Guidelines

We are including two different exercises: one for data modeling, and another
object-oriented design.

* This exercise should not take you more than two hours to complete

# Exercises

## Data modeling

Goal: define a data model for photo galleries that contains albums and photos.

Imagine that it's 2010, and we are starting to build our photo uploading and
processing functionality.

Define a data model that:

* Allows a user to create a photo gallery
* Allows the photo gallery to have photos uploaded into it
* Allows the photo gallery to contain zero or more albums
* Allows the photo gallery's photos to be placed within an album

A complete submission will:

* Illustrate the tables and their relationships to one another
* Illustrate the columns present in each table, along with their data type and
  size
* Be provided in a manner you deem appropriate to accomplish the goal
  (entity-relationship diagram, a series of DDL statements showing the actual
  creation of the tables, etc.).

## Object-oriented programming
