# Back-end Coding Exercise


## Overview

Here at ShootProof, we prefer to have a good idea of a candidate's technical
experience before proceeding with portions of our recruiting process.  We
believe that the technical exercise below will illustrate a candidate's
approach to working with technologies commonly used here at ShootProof.


## Guidelines

The exercise consists of several different parts designed to showcase your
problem-solving and solution-implementation talents. There is not a single
correct answer; this is *not* an exam. We simply want to see how you approach a
business problem and the steps you take to solve it.

* This exercise should not take you more than two or three hours to complete. If
  your solution is taking longer, that's okayâ€”be honest and let us know how long
  it took and why you think it took that long.
* Be as thorough as you wish.
* All exercises are to be performed as if you were on the job.
* You may submit your response in one of the following ways:
  * Package an archive (ZIP, tarball, etc.) of your files and deliver it to
    your contact.
    * If working with a recruiter, deliver it to them.
    * If working with ShootProof directly, deliver to <careers+dev@shootproof.com>.
  * Fork our repository and open a pull request.


## Exercise

Imagine that it's 2010, and ShootProof are starting to build our photo uploading
and processing functionality. This exercise walks you through what it might take
to design and build a very small portion of the ShootProof photo galleries
feature.


### Part 1: Data/domain modeling

**Goal:** define a data/domain model for photo galleries that contains albums
and photos.

Define a data model that:

* Allows a user to create a photo gallery.
* Allows the photo gallery to have photos uploaded into it.
* Allows the photo gallery to contain zero or more albums.
* Optionally allows a photo to be placed within one or more albums.

A complete submission will:

* Define all the relevant entities in the model.
* Illustrate the relationships and, optionally, behaviors among the entities.
* Describe the properties of each entity.
* Be documented in a manner you deem appropriate to accomplish the goal
  (entity-relationship diagram, UML, etc.).

**Extra credit:** Include data definition language (DDL) statements to create
tables for the data model.  Define the columns present in each table, along with
their data type and size.


### Part 2: Object-oriented programming

**Goal:** convert the data/domain model defined in Part 1 into working PHP
classes.

A complete submission will:

* Define all the relevant namespaces and classes as illustrated in your model.
* Include functionality to access and manipulate the data properties of each
  entity in the model.
* Expose the relationships among the entities through the use of code.
* Optionally, include code to illustrate any behaviors you've considered (this
  may be stubbed code).
* Optionally, include unit tests for these classes; if included, we should be
  able to run the tests to see them passing.

**Extra credit:** Show the use of a third-party dependency integrated and used
within your classes.

*Please note: Making database requests from these classes is not in the scope
of this exercise. Instead, focus on translating the domain into classes.*


### (Optional) Part 3: Hypermedia API design (REST)

**Goal:** design endpoints for a hypermedia API that will be used by API
consumers to create, read, update, and delete galleries, albums, and photos.

A complete submission will:

* Design JSON data structures for use in API requests and responses.
* Illustrate what each of your data/domain model entities would look like when
  returned from the API.
* Expose relationships among the entities through the use of hypermedia.
* Define all the operations that may be performed on each entity through the API
  and map HTTP methods to these operations.
* Show example HTTP requests and responses.
* Optionally, be documented in a manner you deem appropriate to accomplish the
  goal (OpenAPI, API Blueprint, Markdown, etc.).
* Optionally, describe the HTTP status codes that might be returned by each
  operation.
* Optionally, design API error responses that might occur for certain
  operations.
